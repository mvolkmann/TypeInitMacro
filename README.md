# TypeInitMacro

This is a Swift macro that adds an initializer to a class or a struct.
The initializer sets all the properties of the class or struct
using the arguments passed to it.
It is based on code from HuangRunHa at
[struct-initial-macro](https://github.com/HuangRunHua/wwdc23-code-notes/tree/main/struct-initial-macro).
